* The screw is supplied as contrary to the picture (which says it isn't supplied). 
* The light has a male USB-A connector. * The light doesn't work with 5V. At least 8VDC is needed. 
* The light has 3 brightness settings (8V/0.2A, 8V/0.5A, 8V/0.8A) 
* Once powered and turning the light on, you have to remove the power to turn it off. Cycling through the brightness states doesn't turn it off. There's no OFF-setting. 
* The screw on bottom of the light is 8mm too long. 
* The screw on bottom of the light is now M4, but it should be M5 (drill out the holes in a plastic mounting piece a little bit). 
* The nut on bottom of the light, in the middle should be a metal spacer. 
* Opening the unit: on the LED-PCB, the two power-LEDs are in parallel, which is unusual. 
* Thermal contact between the LED-PCB and the housing is likely very poor. 
* The lens focus the lens in a very narrow spot, which is useless.  Replace lenses by [Carclo 10003/15](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/carclo-technical-plastics/10003-15/2641692)
